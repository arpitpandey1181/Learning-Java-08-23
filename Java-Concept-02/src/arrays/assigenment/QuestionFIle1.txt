1. Write a program to calculate the average of elements in an array of integers.

2. Write a Java program to reverse an array of integers.

3. Write a program to find the second largest element in an array of integers.

4. Write a program to find the second smallest element in an array of integers.

5. Write a program to remove a specific element from an array.

6. Write a program to add two matrices.

    example :   Enter the number of rows and columns of the matrices: 2 2
                Enter the elements of matrix A:
                1 2
                3 4
                Enter the elements of matrix B:
                5 6
                7 8
                The sum of the two matrices is:
                6 8
                10 12
    
7. Write a Java program to multiply two matrices.
    example : take example of 6 question

8. Write a program to find the row and column with the maximum sum in a matrix.
    example: Input : mat[][] = {
                { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 },
                { 5, 3, 1, 4, 2 },
                { 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 },
                { 0, 6, 3, 4, 12 },
                { 9, 7, 12, 4, 3 },
                }; 

            Output : Row 3 has max sum 35
